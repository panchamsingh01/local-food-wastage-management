## 📦 Project Dependencies Explanation

This project uses the following Python libraries to efficiently handle data processing,
database management, analysis, and application development.

### pandas
Used for reading CSV files, cleaning data, transforming datasets, and preparing data
for SQL storage and analysis. It acts as the main data manipulation tool in the project.

### numpy
Provides numerical computing support and is used internally by pandas for efficient
data operations, handling missing values, and array-based calculations.

### streamlit
Used to build the interactive web application interface. It enables filters, tables,
charts, and CRUD operations without requiring frontend technologies like HTML or JavaScript.

### matplotlib
Used for creating visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and trend analysis
to understand food distribution and wastage patterns.

### seaborn
Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides cleaner and more informative statistical
visualizations, improving the readability of analysis outputs.

### sqlalchemy
Acts as the bridge between Python and the SQL database. It allows structured and
efficient database connections, query execution, and table management.
